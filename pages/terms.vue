                    <h3 class="font-header text-3xl">Code of Conduct</h3>

                    By applying for or taking part in an event, or being a part of our community platforms such as Discord, you agree to behave
                    in a reasonable and sportsmanlike manner. This includes the following rules:

                    <br><br>
                    <ul class="text-left pl-5 list-disc" style="line-height: 2rem;">
                        <li>Be respectful of others, this includes any staff, players, and community members.</li>
                        <li>Do not be excessively toxic, rude, attention-seeking, or generally being a bad sport.</li>
                        <li>Do not use any slurs (including what you can reclaim), or utilize any language or imagery that is discriminatory, suggestive, or sexual.</li>
                        <li>Do not discuss or display any sensitive, political, or potentially triggering topics.</li>
                        <li>
                            Do not use anything that will give an unfair gameplay advantage, or otherwise abusing games - this includes (but is not limited to) exploits,
                            hacks, "cheat" resource packs, auto-clickers (unless you are using it to spam a bell, those are great), cross-teaming, or deliberately trying
                            to break the games, servers, or maps.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>

                    Any further rules relating to a specific event or Discord server can be found on the relevant server / website.

                    Any events, mods, maps, etc. that are created by CrunchMunch Creations may be photographed, recorded, or livestreamed. This includes both on CrunchMunch
                    Creations related channels, as well as any personal channels belonging to the participants, that we do not have control over. By accepting a position in
                    any events, you agree to featuring in such photographs and recordings.

                    <br><br>

                    <h4 class="font-header text-2xl">Events</h4>

                    By accepting a position in a CrunchMunch Creations event, you agree to us using your creator name / nickname, profile picture, links,
                    Minecraft skin / likeness, and any other public-facing information, for the purposes of marketing our events, maps and mods. These may also be used
                    for promoting CrunchMunch Creations or any of its future events <span class="font-bold">in the context of your participation in the event</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    By accepting a position in an event, you agree to us using clips or screenshots of your POV taken during the event, for the purposes of marketing the event.
                    This may also include future events or CrunchMunch Creations as a whole <span class="font-bold">in the context of your participation in the event</span>,
                    for example in any trailers. This may be displayed on the CrunchMunch Creations website, on our social medias, in our communications, or in-game. We will not
                    upload your Twitch VODs, footage edited by you, or any video content that primarily or exclusively focuses on you, to any CrunchMunch Creations-related channels
                    or platforms, without your informed consent.
                    <br><br>

                    <h4 class="font-header text-2xl">Maps / Mods</h4>

                    By creating any content of you playing in a CrunchMunch Creations map or using one of our mods (i.e. livestreaming, recording, photographing), 
                    you agree to us sharing your content on our social medias and websites.
                    <br>
                    <span class="text-sm">(basically, we just want to scream about you playing our maps and mods, because we fangirl about things like this a lot)</span>

                    <br><br>

                    We will not use your information, footage or likeness on commercial materials, such as on merchandise or on donation pages, or to imply an endorsement of
                    CrunchMunch Creations, without your informed consent.

                    <h3 class="font-header text-3xl">Violation of these Terms</h3>

                    CrunchMunch Creations reserves the right to block entry to or remove players from our events or community platforms, at any time, without giving any reason or notice.
                    This may include if we believe you cause risk of harm to an event, server, staff member, player, or community member, based on your actions taken before, during, or
                    after an event.
                    <br><br>
                    Depending on the severity and evidence of the violation, this may also include a temporary or permanent ban from future CrunchMunch Creations events or platforms.
